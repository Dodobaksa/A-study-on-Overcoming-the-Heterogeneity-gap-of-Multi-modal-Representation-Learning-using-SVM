This repository contains the code for the paper titled: A study on Overcoming the Heterogeneity gap of Multi-modal Representation Learning using SVM.

The proposed architecture presents a methodology to overcome the problematic heterogeneity gap in multimodal feature learning.

Text vectors were extracted using Doc2vec.

The image vectors were extracted using Pretrained SE-ResNext.

The methodology was comprehensively verified by utilizing a total of three datasets with Coco dataset, Fakeddit dataset, and Tour dataset.

## Dataset
1.Coco dataset(2017)-Only train dataset was used.

2.Tour dataset-[Tour dataset API Link](https://api.visitkorea.or.kr/#/), It's much more convenient to receive the data set on [this link](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235978/data).

3.Fakeddit dataset-16,124 of the 50,000 data provided by [the validation dataset](https://github.com/entitize/Fakeddit) are used for the experiment.
